    <h2>Theomer</h2>
    <p>
        Theomer was adopted by the family of mages who lived in the castle in which he is now trapped. 
        They believed he would be a good companion for their only child. This child decided one day to 
        try a magical spell that would protect and bind Theomer and himself together forever, but it 
        went wrong and ended up trapping Theomer in the castle. After he met and fell for <a href="heron.html">Heron.</a> 
        he tried to live and ended up trapped underneath the vines that hold him there. Heron returned 
        and was able to free him of the spell by destroying its heart.

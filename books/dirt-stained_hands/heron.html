    <h2>Heron</h2>
    <p>
        Heron is a farmer who lives with eir <a href="ma.html">ma</a> on their farm in the countryside. 
        Ey have a relationship with <a href="tiel.html">Tiel</a> who lives in the city and wants Heron 
        to move in with him. Heron does not want this and is starting to have doubts about their relationship. 
        When Heron receives a note from eir ma stated that she has hurt herself on the road and is resting in 
        an old mage's castle, ey sets out to go and help her as ey fears she might be in trouble. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When Heron arrives at the castle ey finds out that eir ma is doing totally fine and is being looked 
        after by <a href="theomer.html">Theomer</a> who is a somewhat disheveled looking man that lives alone 
        in the castle with some magical animatronics. Theomer offers to pay for Heron's mother to stay and 
        fix the broken down animatronics but Heron sees an opportunity to stay here and get some time away 
        from Tiel and so ey offers to stay and work in the garden in place of eir mother. While Theomer 
        initially declines this, Heron's ma sneaks off in the morning and so the two decide they have no 
        choice but to take on the original gardening proposal. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout eir stay, Heron and Theomer begin to fall for one another, and after Theomer shows Heron 
        his secret, they kiss. Heron tells Theomer that he is in a relationship with Tiel, though he intends 
        to end it, but Theomer asks him to leave and not come back unless asked. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After leaving the castle Heron breaks up with Tiel and—after having a fight—returns to work with eir 
        ma on the farm. One night, a small messenger contraption finds Heron, and leads em back to the castle 
        where ey finds Theomer trapped under vines because he tried to leave the castle. Heron helps him escape 
        by destroying the source of the magic and the two get together.
